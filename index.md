# Welcome to My Site!

Here you can see some of the games and concepts I've created as a hobby.

The twisted star is my biggest independent project, I started it to learn the Unity engine in depth and ended up designing a very ambitious 2D platformer Beat 'em up.
I made all of the assets from scratch, to learn as much as I could.

  <h2>Mechanics</h2>

  <p>I implemented basic 2D platformer mechanics to allow the player some sense of familiarity with the controls, jumping, collectibles, a lifebar and different movement methods like dashing and swinging.
But the main mechanic of this game was what I called the "combo system". Normally, a "combo system" is something one would find in a classic Fighting game, where a combo is a link of quick moves that aren't countered in a short amount of time. 
In the case of this project the "combo system" was instead to not repeat the same attack while you have others available to use, time not mattering. </p>

   <p>Every time that you use an attack that you haven't used before in this combo, the combo meter is raised by 1, and once you repeat an attack, it becomes 0 again. The combo meter is what defines how much damage you do. 
The idea of this mechanic was to make moves that are wildly different from each other so the player had to think fast to keep good damage going, otherwise, the enemies would be hard to defeat.
To add to this gameplay, if you use up all the attacks from one of your weapons, you get a "Set Bonus", which varies depending on the weapon. When you use all the attacks of the sword, your other weapons can hit several opponents at once, 
the whip set bonus makes your other weapons hitbox larger and the hammer gives your other weapons knockback.</p>

  <h2>Story</h2>

  <p>I made a dialogue system with portraits and expressions to convey the story of the game. The main idea was to make this game have hard hitting dramatic moments but generally have an optimistic tone. 
I made two characters that were meant to have different motivations but generally go through the same levels, this way, one could learn new things about the world with a second playthrough or if 
another person was playing the game with the other character the information could be shared.</p>

  <h2>Art</h2>

  <p>The idea for the game was to make it pixel art, however, I also thought that limiting the pallet as much as possible could give the game a realtively unique look. </p>

(The bigger the printed cube, the better the result)


<p>The ARCube is an experimental project that I made with a group of 3 people in about 2 weeks. It uses ARToolkit for Unity to detect 6 specific marks, these marks are meant to be arranged in the shape of a cube. 
Through angle calculations the cube will determine where "down" is and apply gravity to a ball that spawns in the waterdrop mark.</p>
<p>
Each mark will render a room that seems to fit inside of the cube, by moving the cube around you can make the ball fall into holes that lead into neighboring rooms.

# The Witch Bossfight

<p>I made this the project in a team of 4 people using Unity. The idea was to make a bossfight and polish it as much as we could in the free time that we had in a month. </p>
<p>This bossfight had to explain the controls and objective in the least amount of time possible, given the lack of a level to explain the mechanics.</p> 
<p>We made a short obligatory sequence at the start of the game that sets up that you can throw the "chest" in the middle 
of the room. Also, at the start of the fight the player can see that catching the purple attacks of the boss with the chest hurts it.</p>

<p>This project was made to support local schools with physics education for middleschoolers. I worked in this project with 3 other people using the Phaser framework. The objective was to teach the player
to solve physics problems intuitively, thus reducing the anxiety that numbers may cause on kids learning the subject.</p>
<p>A short story was also included in the game to retain the attention of kids who might otherwise abandon the game before finishing it.</p>
<p>The game is only in Spanish, given that that was the target audience's native language.</p>

# Robot Artist

<p>The Robot Artist was a proof of concept that I made with another team member in a very short amount of time. The company we worked for was looking to open a game developing branch, and they specifically wanted to use open source engines, so we chose to use Godot.</p>
<p>This project was meant to be a simple reaction time based game where the objective was to input the instructions on the screen as fast as you could without getting it wrong. The visual part is where it would get more interesting: a picture would start being generated layer by layer as the player progressed, and blotches would start appearing in the picture to reflect the player's mistakes.</p>
